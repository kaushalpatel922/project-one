Tic Tac Toe 

By Kaushal Patel - my attempt of building a first game!

Game Rules:

Tic Tac Toe is a two player game - Player X and Player O. The default is that first player - Player X will make the first move of the game, followed by next move from Player O. At the end of the game, there will be an alert of Player X or Player O. Once there is a win for either player, the score will get updated to the score board above and players keep playing.  However, if there's a tie, it will also alert tie!

If you want to start over the game from beginning at any point, there is a start over button at the bottom to reset.


This game was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This was my first game and was a quite challenge. I never realized how much happens behind the scenes when something looks simple and intuitive. While building this game, I realized the time management and planning out the project is very crucial.

Also, you are not done till you're completely done - so keep going at it till you're finished.
